# sequelize-orm
This project establishes a PostgreSQL database, using the Sequelize ORM to create models and relationships. 

The key aim of this project is to pass complicated relational tests, without seed data. 

The most complex test to setup is the Reviewer test, as its dependencies touch every table in the database.
